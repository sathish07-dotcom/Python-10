    Sure Sathish! Here's a clean and simple set of **notes on Inheritance in Python**â€”perfect for revision or adding to your study material:

---

## ðŸ“˜ Inheritance in Python

### ðŸ”¹ What is Inheritance?
Inheritance is a feature of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** that allows one class (**child class**) to inherit the properties and methods of another class (**parent class**).

---

### ðŸ”¸ Benefits of Inheritance
- Code Reusability  
- Increases Code Organization  
- Promotes Modularity  
- Supports Hierarchical Classification  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Basic Syntax

```python
class Parent:
    def method1(self):
        print("Parent method")

class Child(Parent):
    def method2(self):
        print("Child method")

obj = Child()
obj.method1()  # Inherited from Parent
obj.method2()
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ Types of Inheritance

1. **Single Inheritance**
   - One child class inherits from one parent class.
   ```python
   class A:
       pass

   class B(A):
       pass
   ```

2. **Multiple Inheritance**
   - A child class inherits from multiple parent classes.
   ```python
   class A:
       pass

   class B:
       pass

   class C(A, B):
       pass
   ```

3. **Multilevel Inheritance**
   - A class is derived from a class which is also derived from another class.
   ```python
   class A:
       pass

   class B(A):
       pass

   class C(B):
       pass
   ```

4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**
   - Multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.
   ```python
   class A:
       pass

   class B(A):
       pass

   class C(A):
       pass
   ```

5. **Hybrid Inheritance**
   - Combination of more than one type of inheritance.

---

### ðŸ”¹ `super()` Function
Used to call the constructor or methods of the **parent class**.

```python
class Parent:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Parent constructor")

class Child(Parent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        print("Child constructor")
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ Method Overriding
Child class can override a method of the parent class with its own version.

```python
class Parent:
    def show(self):
        print("Parent")

class Child(Parent):
    def show(self):
        print("Child")

obj = Child()
obj.show()  # Output: Child
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ `isinstance()` and `issubclass()`
- `isinstance(obj, ClassName)` â†’ Checks if object belongs to a class.
- `issubclass(SubClass, ParentClass)` â†’ Checks if a class is a subclass of another.
